<table>
            <col style="width: 50%;" />
            <col style="width: 25%;" />
            <tbody>
              <tr>
        <td><strong>Feature</strong>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Preview</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Fast release</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Quarterly</strong></td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="/help/quicksilver/product-announcements/product-releases/{YY}-q{N}-release-activity/{YY}-q{N}-{area}.md" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}">Feature Title</a><p>Short description of the feature.</p>
        </td>
        <td><p>{Month Day, Year}</p></td>
        <td><p>{Month Day, Year}</p></td>
        <td><p>{Month Day, Year}</p></td>
    </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
```

#### 表规则

- 功能单元格： `<a>`标记，带有`class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{para}"`，后跟`<p>`说明
- `href`链接到产品区域页面（不是特定锚点）
- 日期单元格：包装在`<p>`标记中
- 对于计划外项目，在链接后添加`<p>[!BADGE Off schedule]{type=Neutral}</p>`
- 无需徽章时，可接受链接后清空`<p></p>`
- 保持HTML缩进与现有文件一致

## 需要注意的已知不一致

1. **错误的概述链接季度** — 产品区域页面有时链接到前一季度的概述（例如，`26-q1`而不是`26-q2`）
2. **预览日期显示错误的年份** — 概述表有时在“预览”列中显示上一年（例如，“2025”而不是“2026”）
3. **缺少结束`</tr>`标记** — 某些HTML表行缺少正确的结束标记
4. **`content-type: release-notes`** — 在旧文件中存在，在较新的26-q2产品区域页面中省略。 遵循本季度的模式。
5. 模板中的&#x200B;**拼写错误** — 外观模板有`relesae`而不是`release`；始终使用正确的拼写
6. **功能链接后缺少`<p></p>`** — 某些概述表行在`<a>`标记后省略空的`<p>`标记
